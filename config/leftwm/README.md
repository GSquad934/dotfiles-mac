# My LeftWM Configuration
![](https://i.postimg.cc/3N8hy10N/screenshot-20210324-010.png)

This repository hosts the configuration files for [LeftWM](https://leftwm.org/). The files here consist of a *config.toml* file that contains all the key bindings of the window manager. The rest is part of a custom theme. It features:

* Status bar with *Polybar* with a built-in system tray
* Script to autostart all the necessary programs such as the composer, etc...
* 9 workspaces
* Custom scripts ran by the status bar to display various information

# Dependencies
The following packages are necessary in order to run this build of LeftWM properly:

* ttf-jetbrains-mono
* ttf-joypixels
* polybar
* libxft-bgra (regular *libxft* won't work with my status bar)

The following software are not mandatory but recommended:
* feh (hard-coded in the theme to set a wallpaper)
* dmenu (hard-coded run launcher)
* st (the hard-coded terminal emulator)
* slock (optional, only if you want a lock screen)

*feh*, *st* and *dmenu* are very recommended because those programs are in my LeftWM configuration. This can be customized by modifying either the *config.toml* file or the *themes/mytheme/up* file.

If you want a nice DMenu to be integrated, you can install [my custom build](https://github.com/GSquad934/dmenu). You can check out [my build of ST](https://github.com/GSquad934/st) for a nice terminal emulator. Finally, [my build of *slock*](https://github.com/GSquad934/slock) can be used as a nice lock screen.

# Installation
For Arch based Linux distributions, LeftWM is available in the AUR. Use any AUR helper you want to install this window manager. Here is the necessary command if using *YAY*:

```
yay -S leftwm
```
Then, you also need the files in this repository to actually configure LeftWM and have the theme showcased in the above screenshot.

For other methods of installation, please refer to the documentation on the [LeftWM Github page](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm).

<u>**Note**</u>: *polybar* may only run normally after LeftWM ran at least once. If it is the case, simply logout and login again. This LeftWM installation can be fully automated by using my [bootstrap script](https://github.com/GSquad934/bootstrap).

# Running LeftWM
If you don't use a login manager, you can start the graphical environment with the *startx* command (package "*xorg-xinit*" required) and a properly configured *.xinitrc* file. If you want some inspiration for your *.xinitrc*, you can check out [mine](https://github.com/GSquad934/dotfiles/blob/master/config/X11/xinitrc).

If you use a login manager (such as *lightdm*), LeftWM package installation should have already created a *.desktop* file necessary for the login manager. Otherwise, make sure to create a *leftwm.desktop* file in */usr/share/xsessions/*. The file should contain the following:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=LeftWM
Comment=A window manager for the adventurer
Exec=leftwm
Type=Application
```

# Key Bindings
I configured the key bindings that I like. They are all configured in the *config.toml* file. Here is the full list and what they actually do:

* **MODKEY** has been configured to be the Super key (=Windows key)

| Key binding | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `MODKEY + RETURN` | Open terminal (st is the hard-coded one but it can be modified) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + RETURN` | Open run launcher (dmenu is the run launcher but it can be modified) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + c` | Close window with focus |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + r` | Soft reload LeftWM  |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + q` | Quit LeftWM |
| `MODKEY + 1-9` | Switch focus to workspace (1 to 9) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + 1-9` | Send focused window to workspace (1 to 9) |
| `MODKEY + j` | Focus stack +1 (switches focus between windows in the stack) |
| `MODKEY + k` | Focus stack -1 (switches focus between windows in the stack) |
| `MODKEY + i` | Move focused window at the top of the stack (=master) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + j` | Rotate stack +1 (rotates the windows in the stack) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + k` | Rotate stack -1 (rotates the windows in the stack) |
| `MODKEY + h` | Decrease focused window width |
| `MODKEY + l` | Increase focused window width |
| `MODKEY + right` | Switch to the next workspace |
| `MODKEY + left` | Switch to the previous workspace |
| `MODKEY + l` | Increase focused window width |
| `MODKEY + Tab` | Cycle to the next layout |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + Tab` | Cycle to the previous layout |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + w` | Move to the last workspace |
| `MODKEY + w` | Swap tags |
| `MODKEY + ALT + l` | Lock the screen |

<u>**Note**</u>: the key bindings in this configuration are a bit limited because I actually use *SXHKD* to run all my applications. My configuration for *SXHKD* can be found in [my dotfiles](https://github.com/GSquad934/dotfiles/blob/master/config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc). My configuration file for *SXHKD* is totally based on my personal dotfiles, so you will need to modify either the key bindings of LeftWM or have a custom *sxhkdrc* ready.

# Status Bar
In the custom theme offered by this repository, [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) has been configured to act as the status bar

![](https://i.postimg.cc/kXjJb0cm/screenshot-20210324-009.png)

* üì¶ 0 : indicates how many updates are available (script: *updates.sh*)
* üñ•Ô∏è 2%: indicates the CPU usage
* üß† 35% : indicates the RAM usage
* ‚¨á  120B ‚¨Ü  60B : indicates the download/upload network traffic usage. It will automatically change B/KB/MB depending on the usage
* üíæ 8.2G (38%) : indicates the disk space usage where "/" is mounted. Other disks can be added by modifying the script
* üå° 25.2 : indicates the CPU temperatur (will indicate 0 if no sensors are found)
* üîä 60% : indicates the volume level. The icon will change depending on the volume level
* üïí Wed, February 24 21:39 : indicates the current day, date and time in 24H format
* The system tray on the right will display whatever icon is required in the systray

While certain information are internal to *Polybar*, others actually require the usage of scripts. All scripts are part of the theme and can be found in the *themes/mytheme/scripts* folder.

# Wallpapers
*Feh* is used to setup the wallpaper. A default wallpaper (file: *background.jpg*) is supplied with this theme for LeftWM. However, it is possible to setup a custom wallpaper by either replacing the file *themes/mytheme/background.jpg* or by storing some custom wallpapers in a folder such as *$HOME/.local/share/wallpapers* and modify the command in the *themes/mytheme/up* file to be:

```
feh --bg-fill --no-fehbg --randomize "$HOME"/.local/share/wallpapers*
```

If you want a set of nice wallpapers, I have some stored in this [repository](https://github.com/GSquad934/wallpapers).
